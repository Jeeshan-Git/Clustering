# Clustering Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores various clustering algorithms—K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN—to group data points into clusters based on their similarities. The primary objective is to understand the strengths and use cases of these algorithms and apply them to a real-world dataset.

## Project Description
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to find groups within unlabelled data. This project involves implementing and comparing three popular clustering techniques:

* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
The dataset used in this project underwent preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends before applying clustering algorithms.

## Dataset Details
Features:
* Cleaned and scaled to ensure compatibility with clustering algorithms.
* Outliers were identified and removed to improve cluster quality.
EDA:
* Visualizations like scatter plots and histograms were used to understand data distribution and identify potential clusters.
  
## Technologies Used
  
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
 
## Steps Performed
1 Data Preprocessing:

* Handled missing values and scaled features.
* Removed outliers to enhance clustering quality.
  
2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conducted analysis to identify hidden patterns and distributions.
* Utilized multiple visualizations to gain insights.
  
3 Clustering Algorithms:

* K-Means:
* Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
* Hierarchical Clustering:
* Experimented with different linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average).
* DBSCAN:
* Tuned parameters like epsilon (ε) and minPts for optimal results.
  
4 Visualization:

* Generated scatter plots to visualize cluster separation.
* Used distinct colors to represent different clusters for clarity.
  
5 Cluster Analysis:

* Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster.
* Documented key insights in the code as comments.
  
6 Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluated clusters using metrics like the silhouette score for K-Means and DBSCAN.

# Results and Insights
* Key Findings:
* K-Means performed well with [specific findings].
* Hierarchical Clustering provided insights into hierarchical relationships between clusters.
* DBSCAN effectively identified noise points and dense regions in the dataset.
* Evaluation:
* Silhouette scores highlighted the strengths of each algorithm in separating clusters.
